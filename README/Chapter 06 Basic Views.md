## Chapter 6: Basic Views

In practice, the default view is never acceptable for a business application. 
Instead, we should at least organize the various fields in a logical manner. 
Views are defined in XML files with actions and menus. They are instances of the ir.ui.view model.

In our real estate module, we need to organize the fields in a logical way:
- in the list view, we want to display more than just the name. 
- in the form view, the fields should be grouped. 
- in the search view, we must be able to search on more than just the name. Specifically, we want a filter for the ‘Available’ properties and a shortcut to group by postcode.
